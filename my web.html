          <p>React</p>
          <div id="beach" class="img"></div>
          <p>
            This is a beach resort site built in react. In it is used most
            amazing features in react like hooks and life cycle methods. React
            best practices were fully observed in creating the components; each
            performing a specific task and not being overloaded. The site is
            built in with interesting features. Below is the link to the github
            repository of the codes and the link to the hosted site: <br />

          <h1>Computer Based Test App</h1>
          <p>React</p>
          <div id="beach" class="img"></div>
          <p>
            This is a Computer Based Test App built in react. I utilised hooks
            and life cycle methods in creating it. React best practices were
            fully observed in creating the components; each performing a
            specific task and not being overloaded. The program is meant for
            students in institutions to have study questions in the exam format
            at their grasp. This, if employed by institutions, will solve the
            issues of missing scripts, stressful marking and result compilation
            as well as miscalculation of results. Also, assignments and tests
            can be given by lecturers and teachers alike to students using such
            a platform. Below is the link to the github repository of the codes
            and the link to the hosted site: <br />
